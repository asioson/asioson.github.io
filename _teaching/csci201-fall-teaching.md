Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms is a graduate-level course that covers the fundamental concepts of algorithm analysis and implementation that are widely used in computational science.  Analysis is a core part of this course where students will be able to assess the time complexity of algorithms and its effect when used in various applications. Additionally, optimization and NP-completeness will be covered. This course builds on the undergraduate course on data structures and algorithms.
