Programming Languages and Paradigms is a graduate-level course. Fundamentally, programming languages are notations and hence provide rules for programmingâ€”for specifying, organizing, and reasoning about computations. Programming paradigms are ways of thinking about programming.  This course will discuss different programming languages and paradigms and compare their underlying concepts.
