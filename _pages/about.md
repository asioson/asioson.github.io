I aim to build robust systems that automates routine calibrations of explainable analytics models and topic modeling of text verbatims. It is important that the models are hardworking and provides data-driven insights to enable informed business decisions.

I am passionate about designing relevant and timely curricular programs in computer science. I intend to make the courses I teach much more engaging and fun to learn.
