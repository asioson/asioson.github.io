I aim to build robust systems that automate backend analytics processes such as regular calibrations of explainable forecasting models with exogenous variables and labeling text verbatims using generative pre-trained models. It is important that the systems are hardworking and provide data-driven insights to enable informed business decisions.

I am also passionate about designing relevant and timely curricular programs in computer science. As a teacher, I intend to make the courses I teach much more engaging and fun to learn.
