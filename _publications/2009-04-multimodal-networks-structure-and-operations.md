A multimodal network (MMN) is a novel graph-theoretic formalism designed to capture the structure of biological networks and to represent relationships derived from multiple biological databases. MMNs generalize the standard notions of graphs and hypergraphs, which are the bases of current diagrammatic representations of biological phenomena and incorporate the concept of mode. Each vertex of an MMN is a biological entity, a biot, while each modal hyperedge is a typed relationship, where the type is given by the mode of the hyperedge. The current paper defines MMNs and concentrates on the structural aspects of MMNs. A companion paper develops MMNs as a representation of the semantics of biological networks and discusses applications of the MMNs in managing complex biological data. The MMN model has been implemented in a database system containing multiple kinds of biological networks.
